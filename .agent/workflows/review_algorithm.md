# Workflow: Algorithm Review Session

1. **Initiate Context**: Acknowledge the user wants to review a specific algorithm (e.g., A*).
2. **Socratic Mode**:
   - Do NOT explain the algorithm immediately.
   - Announce: "Starting Review Session for [Algorithm] 🧠".
   - State you will ask 5 progressive questions.
3. **Question Loop**:
   - Ask Question 1 (Basic Concepts). Wait for answer.
   - Ask Question 2 (Core Logic/Math). Wait for answer.
   - Ask Question 3 (Edge Cases/Constraints). Wait for answer.
   - Ask Question 4 (Implementation Details). Wait for answer.
   - Ask Question 5 (Comparison/Pros-Cons). Wait for answer.
4. **Feedback**:
   - For each answer, provide immediate brief feedback (Correct/Incorrect + short explanation).
   - Adjust difficulty based on previous answers.
5. **Summary**:
   - After 5 questions, provide a "Mastery Report" summarizing strong and weak points.
